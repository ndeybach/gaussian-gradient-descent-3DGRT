This repository has only the purpose to host the associated article written by Nils DEYBACH on the gradient descent of a fully 3D gaussian splatting pipeline.

This article is available:
- in raw file format at: [gaussian-gradient-descent-3DGRT.md](gaussian-gradient-descent-3DGRT.md)
- in html / readable format at: [gaussian-gradient-descent-3DGRT.html](gaussian-gradient-descent-3DGRT.html)
- in PDF format (not intended to be the main reading format / can include formatting errors) at: [gaussian-gradient-descent-3DGRT.pdf](gaussian-gradient-descent-3DGRT.pdf)

The article is meant to be edited and generated with vscode and the "Markdown Preview Enhanced" extension. Especially because it supports katex and mermaid rendering (not all markdown rendering engines are created equal ðŸ˜…).
